abstract: "Although it is well established that experts perform better than novices,
there is a lack of formal methods to quantify the potential impact of expertise on
the quality of design outcomes. The research question addressed through this behavioral
experiment is: How can the impact of expertise on the quality of design solutions be quantified?"
