abstract: "Design Fixation is a phenomenon where designers unknowingly limit
the space within which they search for solutions. That is, they become 'blinded'
to solutions other than the ones they are considering. This can be a problem in
professional practice, and also in educational settings.
The established research methods that are used to study design fixation suffer
from a number of weaknesses, including limited data collection and highly subjective
analysis. To address this, we propose using an adapted computer-based version of the
experimental paradigm originally used to study process fixation, also called Mental
Set or the Einstellung Effect. This will permit better data capture,
a more objective analysis of design behaviour and also allow us to connect design
fixation research to a broader set of psychological studies."
