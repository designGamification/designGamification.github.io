## Workshop Aim: ##

The goal of the workshop is to bring system design and human-computer interaction researchers
together to (1) share design research and education challenges that can benefit from crowdsourcing,
and to (2) identify research problems in applying human computation and gamification to these
challenges. The workshop also aims to promote collaborations on development of gamification ideas,
tools and validation mechanisms. Games have been used as crowdsourcing tools in various aspects of
design research to incentivize the crowd for providing inputs and as educational tools for teaching
in an entertaining way. Examples of successful implementations include Foldit, eteRNA, EcoRacer,
BioGames and many more. Relevant studies in design with various applications will be reviewed and
discussed. The organizers hope that one or more review-type papers may result from this event
suitable for submission to the Design Science Journal.

Sample topics identified for this workshop include (but not limited to) the following:

* Games for design concept generation and design optimization
* Statistical learning of design heuristics from a crowd
* Standard efficiency measure of human computation and gamification
* Classification and modeling of human problem solving skills
* Mechanism design for games with a purpose
* Competitive and collaborative games for design research
* Games for design education

## Important dates: ##
* May 27: Submissions due
* June 10: Notification of acceptance
* 25 June 2:00pm - 5:30pm: Workshop

## Submission information:##
Participants can simply attend the workshop but they may also make a presentation/demonstration. To be considered for a presentation, participants are asked to submit the topic title and a 500-word description to dcc16gaming@umich.edu by May 27, 2016. Inclusion of an interactive demo that can be demonstrated in real time at the workshop is encouraged. The workshop committee will select or suggest integration of presentations and times allocated to provide balance of topics and will inform the participants by June 10, 2016.

## Workshop format:##
The half-day workshop will consist of five sessions. A 10-min workshop introduction will be presented by the workshop chairs, followed by four 20-min selected presentations. In addition to their research/education goals and approaches, presenters shall provide real-time demonstrations or experiments that require interaction with participants. We will then have a 30-min break/interaction session to allow participants to evaluate the presented interaction tools. If technically feasible, the presenters will process the interaction results and present their analysis or demonstrate the usage of the collected interaction data once the workshop resumes after the break session. In the last session (90 min), participants will form discussion groups to identify (1) potential applications of gamification in design activities and design education, (2) technical challenges in realizing the benefit of gamification, (3) effective gamification mechanisms and tools, (4) potential funding and publication sources.
