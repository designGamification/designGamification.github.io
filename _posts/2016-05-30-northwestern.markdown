abstract: "The objective of this presentation is to demonstrate how the analytical game-theoretic models and behavioral experimentation can be synergistically used to gain a better understanding of design situation, thereby facilitating the engineering design. Engineering design is often carried out under competition from other designers or firms, where each competitor invests effort with the hope of winning a contract, winning customers, or a prize. A special scenario of design under competition is crowdsourcing where designers compete for monetary prize. Motivated by this observation, this presentation is particularly focused on the decision-making in crowdsourced design. I will present an economic decision game which well captures main characteristics of design activities in crowdsourcing."
