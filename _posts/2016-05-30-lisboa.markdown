abstract: "Organisational Life Assistant (OLA) is an European AAL project that is
developing technological solutions to allow seniors to be more independent,
self-assured and to have a healthier and safer life in close communication with
their caretakers. This paper focuses on a specific feature of our solution, namely,
the OLA-Environment Analysis (OLA-EA) that provides the technological means to prevent
hazard daily situations at home, based on space geometry or other indoor obstacles
such as furniture. Game mechanics such as house scanning percentage of completeness
or constant feedback while scanning could help in engaging users and, because it's
a lone process, it could also benefit from multiplayer mechanics where the users
could raise awareness about their own identified hazard situations by sharing them
with others and thus increasing the acceptance of our service."
